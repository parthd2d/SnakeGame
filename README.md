# Snake Game in Python (Turtle Graphics)

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game provides an enjoyable and interactive experience where players control a snake to collect food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.


## Features

- **User Controls:** Use WASD keys to control the snake's direction (up, left, down, right).
- **Scoring:** Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
- **Food Generation:** Random generation of food items on the screen for the snake to consume.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself, displaying the player's final score.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/parthd2d/SnakeGame

   cd snake-game-python-turtle
   ```

4. Run the game using the following command:

   ```
   python snake_game.py
   ```

5. Use the WASD keys to control the snake's direction and collect food items to grow and score points.

6. Be careful not to collide with the wall or the snake's own body, as it will result in the end of the game.
